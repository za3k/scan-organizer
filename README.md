# transcribe
Small graphical tool for organizing and transcribing scanned documents.

```
Usage: organize.py [DIRECTORY]
```

![Screenshot of organize.py](screenshot.jpg)

On one side of the screen the image is displayed (my scanner sucks, as you can see). On the other, you can change the category (folder) of the photo or the name. Buttons are provided to transcribe (type up the text contents), crop or rotate the current photo.

A button is provided to advance to the next unsorted photo, or the next un-transcribed photo.

The transcriptions are just saved as (for the example file IMG_0033.JPG): IMG_0033.JPG.txt, etc.
